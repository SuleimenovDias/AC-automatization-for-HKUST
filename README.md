# AC-automatization-for-HKUST
This project automates air-conditioner (AC) toggling in HKUST dormitories to save electricity costs by controlling the AC power at scheduled intervals. Since the universityâ€™s AC system charges by usage time and requires logging into a web portal, this script uses Python + Selenium.
